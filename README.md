OmniScript runs by default on a OmniScriptUniversalPage, but if we need to overwrite the out of the box functionality, here are the following steps.

## 

1. Create a new version of OS from TrainingUIFlow and update the name to `TrainingUIUXFlow` and subtype to `UIUXFlow`.
2. Click on `How to launch activated script` button.
3. Under `Embedded` section, select `Newport` and copy the script below.
4. Goto `SetUp`, in the Quick Find search for `Visualforce pages`. Create a `New` Visualforce page.
5. Set the Label and Name as `TrainingUIFlow` and Enable Lightning Experience.
6. Insert the previously copied script from Step 3 into the Visualforce page.
